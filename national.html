  Don't let Amazon get any bigger

<h2>
  A damning congressional report about Big Tech helps make the case to break up
  Jeff Bezos’ empire.
</h2>

<p>
  We tend to credit Amazon’s enormous reach to its inventiveness. Jeff Bezos has
  built a logistics operation that rivals UPS and FedEx in the volume of
  packages it delivers to consumers in the United States. Amazon’s Alexa is the
  dominant operating system in the new arena of voice-enabled devices and web
  access.
</p>

<p>
  Amazon produces clothing and advanced computer chips, dispenses a growing
  share of the nation’s prescription drugs, markets surveillance services to
  police departments, and runs a rapidly expanding advertising business.
</p>

<p>
  But the evidence presented this week in
  <a
    href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/06/technology/house-antitrust-report-big-tech.html"
  >
    a long report by the Judiciary Committee<a />, following a bipartisan
    investigation of the tech giants, tells a very different story. Amazon’s
    website forms a choke point through which other companies must pass to reach
    the market. It has exploited this commanding position to strong-arm other
    companies, control their means of distribution and drive them out of
    business.

    <p>
      While the report concludes that Apple, Facebook and Google are also
      abusing their monopoly power, its findings about Amazon deserve our
      special attention. Through its marketplace, cloud division and voice
      interface, Amazon functions as essential infrastructure for an astonishing
      array of companies and industries. This gives it an extraordinary view
      into the activities of other businesses and an unparalleled ability to
      manipulate markets to its own advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preventing dangerous concentrations of private power is part of the
      necessary checks and balances of a democratic society, and it is
      Congress’s responsibility. The Judiciary Committee offers several
      proposals for what Congress should consider doing; the most important is
      its suggestion to break up Amazon and the other companies in “structural
      separations.”
    </p>

    <p>
      To better understand why, it’s helpful to take a closer look at exactly
      how Amazon became such a force.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today it controls a major share of the logistics industry. It’s now
      delivering two-thirds of the items ordered on its website and a growing
      share of those purchased on other sites, such as eBay. Analysts expect
      Amazon to surpass UPS and FedEx in total package volume by 2022. It’s also
      rapidly gaining on the Postal Service, which saw its parcel volume shrink
      last year, in part because of Amazon’s inroads.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amazon accomplished this feat not just by competing with these other
      carriers on price and service. Rather, it exploited its control over the
      many businesses that depend on its website to reach consumers. It did this
      by making a seller’s visibility on its site, which dominates e-commerce
      traffic, largely contingent on buying Amazon’s warehousing and shipping
      services. Not surprisingly, the share of sellers using these services has
      skyrocketed and now tops more than 85 percent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amazon’s path to commanding the voice sector began with a series of
      acquisitions, including a British company that had created software with a
      remarkable grasp of natural language. That technology, on which Alexa was
      built, gave Amazon a crucial head start. It then leveraged its dominance
      in e-commerce and sheer size to take over this emerging field.
    </p>

    <p>
      One tactic involved frequently putting its Echo line of smart speakers on
      sale, which some saw as effectively selling them at a loss. While Amazon
      can rely on revenue from other parts of its empire to subsidize such loss
      leaders, smaller competitors, such as Sonos, can’t do the same. Amazon
      also restricted competitors from promoting their speakers on its site. And
      entrepreneurs told The Wall Street Journal that Amazon appeared to use its
      venture capital arm, the Alexa Fund, to help develop competing products.
      (Amazon has disputed their account.) Eight months after investing in the
      start-up Nucleus and getting an up-close look at its proprietary
      information, for example, Amazon announced an Alexa-enabled device that
      did many of the same things as Nucleus.
    </p>

    <p>
      These tactics have put rivals at a distinct disadvantage, no matter how
      superior their products. Echo now accounts for nearly 70 percent of the
      U.S. smart-speaker market. And with Alexa functioning as the intermediary
      between users and the appliances and services they interact with, Amazon
      has gained a rich stream of data that it can use to expand into still more
      industries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Bezos has often described Amazon’s strategy as a “flywheel” — the idea
      that momentum in each area of its business drives momentum in the others,
      creating a machine that spins ever faster. This is a metaphor for
      monopolization. Amazon exploits its power in one sector to take over
      neighboring markets. Each new conquest adds more momentum. The flywheel
      accelerates.
    </p>

    <p>
      And it poses a considerable threat to American vitality. Investors talk of
      a “kill zone” for start-ups around the tech giants — broad segments of the
      market that lack competition because new entrants are seen as doomed and
      cannot attract investment.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not only the big ideas that we’re in danger of losing; independent
      businesses are disappearing, and with them a crucial source of new ideas
      and products. A survey of about 1,000 independent businesses last year
      showed that Amazon overwhelmingly ranked as their top challenge. Most of
      those who responded, including most of those selling on its platform, said
      that Amazon is hurting their business. The loss of these businesses
      doesn’t just dampen innovation; it saps the strength and well-being of
      communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is why the most important of the Judiciary Committee’s
      recommendations is its call for legislation that would effectively split
      up big tech platforms like Amazon by breaking them up in “structural
      separations” and forbidding them from operating in adjacent lines of
      business to those they are already dominant in.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach has been used in the past. In the early 20th century,
      Congress barred railroads from producing and distributing goods that
      required rail transport. Policymakers employed a similar approach to
      telecommunications and banking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compelling Amazon to spin off its online marketplace, retail, cloud and
      logistics divisions as distinct companies would eliminate its ability to
      exploit its dominance in one part of its business to thwart competition in
      another.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that isn’t enough to restore a fair and open online market. We also
      need rules that would require major digital platforms to provide
      reasonable terms for access to their platforms and bar them from
      discriminating against companies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, it’s imperative to correct the failings in antitrust enforcement
      that have enabled Amazon to amass such power and abuse it. In recent
      decades, the courts and the antitrust agencies have weakened our once
      strong antitrust laws. As a result, Amazon has been able to vanquish
      competitors using tactics such as predatory pricing that might have
      invited criminal prosecution in an earlier era.
    </p>

    <p>
      This permissive stance, the committee found, has also allowed Amazon to
      buy up other companies with the aim of snuffing out potential rivals and
      taking control of emerging technologies. Its report calls for imposing new
      hurdles on acquisitions by the tech giants and legislation to restore the
      vigor of the antitrust laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jeff Bezos once led an inventive start-up, but today he commands an
      impenetrable empire. “No company is likely to pose a threat to Amazon’s
      dominance in the near or distant future,” the House investigation
      concludes. There is no other rival, no matter how smart, creative, or
      popular, that can change that. Congress will have to step in.
