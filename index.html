        The Lakers' Winding Path Ends With a Championsip

        <b>
          The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in six games to take home the franchise’s 17th championship. It was the fourth title for LeBron James.
          </b>
      </p>
      <p>
It was not a season. For the Los Angeles Lakers, it was an obstacle course.
      </p>

      <p>
It was 12 months packed with tragedies and togetherness. It was disjointed and odd, unprecedented and often unpleasant, an odyssey that began for them in a Chinese hotel amid a geopolitical feud and ended in a mostly empty arena at Walt Disney World, the site of the world’s most famous bubble since the invention of chewing gum.
      </p>

      <p>
But for all the disruptive forces that rocked the N.B.A., the Lakers triumphed in the end.
      </p>

      <p>
The Lakers won their 17th championship — and their first with LeBron James as their centerpiece — with a 106-93 victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday night in Game 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A mere 355 days after the Lakers played their season opener before a packed crowd at Staples Center in Los Angeles, they toppled the Heat, four games to two, to finish off their playoff run on an elaborate made-for-TV sound stage that lacked spectators, aside from a few of the players’ family members and friends.
      </p>

      <p>
It was one of the hard realities of competing for a title in a pandemic, one that had forced the N.B.A. to suspend its season for more than four months before play resumed in July within the league’s self-contained slice of Disney World outside Orlando, Fla. The Lakers went about their business in isolation, winning it all as their fans cheered from home.

“It doesn’t matter where it happens if you win a championship,” James said not long after leaving a court covered in confetti, a victory cigar in his right hand. “A bubble, Miami, Golden State — it doesn’t matter. When you get to this point, it’s one of the greatest feelings in the world for a basketball player to be able to win at the highest level.”       
      </p>

      <p>
No player was more brilliant than James, who, at age 35, was named the finals’ most valuable player for the fourth time in his career. After making his ninth trip to the finals in the past 10 seasons, and his 10th appearance over all, James has now won four championships with three franchises. He powered Sunday’s rout — the Lakers led by as many as 36 — with 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. For the series, he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists while shooting 59 percent from the field.
      </p>

      <p>
James was pushed by the Heat’s Jimmy Butler, who solidified his place as one of the league’s most dynamic two-way players. Butler had extended the series in Game 5 by finishing with 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, his second triple-double of the series.        
      </p>

      <p>
Ultimately, Butler and Heat posed just one final test for the Lakers, who felt the effects of the league’s longest season.

        Rafael Nadal Routs Novak Djokovic at French Open to Catch Roger Federer
      </h3>

        <i>NY Times, Christopher Clarey, 11/10/2020</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Rafael Nadal won his 20th Grand Slam men’s singles championship to tie Roger Federer’s record. It was Nadal’s 13th title at the French Open.
          </b>
      </p>
      <p>
Neither Novak Djokovic nor Roger Federer could resist Rafael Nadal on Sunday.
      </p>

      <p>
Nadal made astonishingly quick work of them both in the French Open final, overwhelming Djokovic, the world’s No. 1 player, 6-0, 6-2, 7-5, to equal Federer’s record of 20 Grand Slam singles titles.

It was quite possibly Nadal’s finest performance at Roland Garros, which sounds like a reach considering that he had already won 12 Grand Slam singles title on the same rectangle of red clay.
      </p>

      <p>
But there was nothing unlucky about No. 13. He was on target from the opening game, breaking Djokovic’s serve under the closed roof at the Philippe Chatrier Court. Nadal, 34 years old but still an irresistible force, ripped groundstrokes with depth and purpose, hunted down drop shots, read Djokovic’s mind and serve and kept his unforced errors to a strict minimum. He made just two in the opening set — one of those on the opening point — and 14 in the match, giving his more erratic and increasingly edgy rival little time or space to find his mojo.
      </p>

      <p>
Djokovic, the 2016 French Open champion, is one of only two men to beat Nadal at Roland Garros. He had defeated Nadal in their last three Grand Slam matches against each other.
      </p>
      
      <p>
The most recent of those came at the 2019 Australian Open final, where Djokovic overwhelmed Nadal, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3, in what Djokovic still maintains was the finest performance of his career.
      </p>
      
      <p>
But that rout took place on a hardcourt, Djokovic’s best surface, at the major tournament he has won most often. Sunday’s payback came in Nadal’s kingdom.        
      </p>
      
      <p>
“Sorry for today,” Nadal said to Djokovic on court.
      </p>
      
      <p>
Later, he elaborated. “As you know, I am not a big fan of revenge,” Nadal said. “I just accept when the things are not going the way that I like. In Australia, he played amazing.” He added: “Today was a little bit the opposite.”
